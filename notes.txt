Starting a game:

Client: Display loading screen
Client -> Server: open socket
Server -> Client: Acknowledge
Client -> Server: Send login name
Server -> Client: Send to game
Server -> Interface: addPlayer(socket, id)
Interface -> GameInterface: addPlayer(socket, id)
GameInterface: players << socket
GameInterface: player_objects << Player.new(socket, id)
Player: data = database.lookup(id)
Player -> GameInterface: send data to socket
Client: Load player's data
Client: Display player's data

if this is the second player:
    GameInterface: send to each player "start game"
    GameInterface: game = Game.new(player_objects)
    Game -> GameInterface: request_player_action(players, start_game)
    Client->Server: (socket, action [starting hero])
    Server->Interface: (socket, action)
    Interface: game_interfaces[socket].send(socket, action)

    Once both players have responded:
        GameInterface -> Game: start_game(actions)
